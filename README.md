# qView
This fork of qView has been mostly incorporated back into the official version! It still contains these exclusive features:
* Option to constrain image position to keep it snapped inside the viewport.
* Shows zoom level in titlebar in Practical/Verbose mode.
* Custom titlebar mode based on format string.
* Option to make zoom level relative to screen pixels (for Windows/Linux users with DPI scaling enabled; not so useful in macOS due to the way it handles scaling).
* Menu toggle to preserve zoom level when changing between images.
* Random file navigation (Go -> Random File, or "r" keyboard shortcut) to browse randomly without changing sort mode.
* Configurable window positioning behavior after matching image size.
