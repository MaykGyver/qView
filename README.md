# qView
This fork of qView has been mostly incorporated back into the official version! It still contains these exclusive features:
* Option to constrain image position to keep it snapped inside the viewport.
* Shows zoom level in titlebar in Practical/Verbose mode.
* Option to make zoom level relative to screen pixels (for Windows/Linux users with DPI scaling enabled; not so useful in macOS due to the way it handles scaling).
* Menu toggle to preserve zoom level when changing between images.
